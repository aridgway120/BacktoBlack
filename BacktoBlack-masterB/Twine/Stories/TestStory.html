As your eyes adjust to the darkness, you see you’re in a small, enclosed space with freezers lining the walls. Your gaze settles on a poster of children enjoying iced treats, bringing the startling realization that you&#x27;re on the floor of an ice cream truck.

Looking around, you see the huddled shapes of four other people. Three are still bound and unconscious.
In the nearest corner is a nerdy-looking guy, who has managed to knock his mask off and is rocking back and forth rhythmically in silence. His hands are still bound.
Across from you is a a girl, also maskless, who has managed to loosen her wrist restraints and free her hands. It kind of looks like she’s rolling a joint.

The truck suddenly stops and everyone is tossed to the front of the truck. The Nerd hits his head hard, knocking him unconscious and bloody. The Stoner squeals “wheeeeeee!” and seems completely unphased. The sudden jolt wakes up the instigator, who has been silent and motionless up to this point. You can’t really tell if the Jock is alive or dead; his body remains totally limp.

You hear the sound of something hissing, and notice a sudden drop in temperature. Before it was cold but now it’s absolutely freezing. In just a t-shirt and shorts, you’re not going to last long.

A man emerges out of a shadow in a bulky trench coat. He opens it, revealing an array of items hidden on the inside. To your surprise, there’s another trench coat underneath. He has a knife, a ripe banana, and a copy of Half Life 3.

You step back and unleash a deadly high-kick onto the Instigator’s skull, but he’s so meaty that it barely phases him. However, while he is stronger, you are faster. You manage to dodge most of his attacks, while your srtikes seem to have little affect. It’s a stalemate.

The Stoner, completely captivated by the scene pulls a banana out of her hat that she’s been stashing. She eats the whole thing, tossing the peel on the ground as you and the instigator have the battle of your lives. Seizing the opportunity, you manage to push the banana peel under the instigator. He slips, smashing his head on a protruding corner of the truck, and crumples in a heap. 

You let out a victory cry, and the Stoner applauds.
