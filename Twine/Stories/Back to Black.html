Looking around, you see the huddled shapes of four other people. Three are still bound and unconscious.
In the nearest corner is a nerdy-looking guy, who has managed to knock his mask off and is rocking back and forth rhythmically in silence. His hands are still bound.
Across from you is a a girl, also maskless, who has managed to loosen her wrist restraints and free her hands. It kind of looks like she’s rolling a joint.

The story so far:
You find yourself trapped in a rotating roster of scenarios both terrifying and ridiculous, forced to resurrect and relive until you manage to escape. Aware that you are a black man trapped in a horror film (with all the stereotypical tropes and hardships that follow), you must use all your cunning to stay alive and see this adventure through to the end. The wrong decision can – no, WILL – lead you to your death. Die. Learn. Repeat.

The cast of characters:

The Jock
More brawn than brains, he is your typical tough guy who serves as the “big brother” figure of the group, though his motives are not always as clear as they appear.
&lt;img src=&quot;images/joc.png&quot; alt=&quot;failure!&quot; width=&quot;370&quot; height=&quot;370&quot;&gt;

The Nerd
The brains of the crew. His ability to think quick on his feet (and overthink in some cases) is a gift and a curse. He can quickly become overwhelmed and breakdown under pressure.
&lt;img src=&quot;images/ner.png&quot; alt=&quot;failure!&quot; width=&quot;370&quot; height=&quot;370&quot;&gt;

The Stoner
The cheery comic relief of the crew. She always seems to be in her own world no matter what type of near death scenario the group finds themselves in. But don’t underestimate her… she’s a survivor if nothing else.
&lt;img src=&quot;images/sto.png&quot; alt=&quot;failure!&quot; width=&quot;370&quot; height=&quot;370&quot;&gt;

The Investigator
Smart? Debatable. Brave? Mostly. Insane? Definitely. No matter the danger, he’s always the first one to suggest investigating the scene for clues and splitting up (among the numerous other norms we’ve grown to love in classic horror films).
&lt;img src=&quot;images/inv.png&quot; alt=&quot;failure!&quot; width=&quot;370&quot; height=&quot;370&quot;&gt;

The Mysterious Mystical Dude
A supernatural aid of sorts that magically appears at just the right moment, offering you an ultimatum that can either save your life or doom you. 
&lt;img src=&quot;images/mys.png&quot; alt=&quot;failure!&quot; width=&quot;370&quot; height=&quot;370&quot;&gt;

You
The unlikely hero, conscious of his horrific fate, but determined to make it out alive (eventually)

Have you made it?!

The Jock wakes up and begins thrashing. The tower topples crushing you, leaving you immobilized until you suffocate.

You won, I guess. But you also died...

They are chanting

It’s a scene of joy... until you realize the Jock never had to die.
Did anyone have to die? 

A hidden doorway opens, and the slightly charred Stoner appears and lights up a joint.

“Wow, what a thing of beauty. Hahaha... took you long enough.”
