In the nearest corner is a nerdy-looking guy, who has managed to knock his mask off and is rocking back and forth rhythmically in silence. His hands are still bound.
Across from you is a a girl, also maskless, who has managed to loosen her wrist restraints and free her hands. It kind of looks like she’s rolling a joint.

It seems you&#x27;re in a decrepit house. There are stairways leading up and down, and a closed door. Under the stairwell is a storage closet. All except the basement stairs are blocked off by inhuman, red eyed, dwarf-like creatures, who are sweating profusely. They are armed with guns and makeshift weapons. A smell akin to garlic mixed with untreated sewage assails your nostrils, and you realize that it is coming from the menacing miniature creatures.

You catch the gaze of one of them and it screams out, &quot;ALL CHEATERS DIE... SLOWLY&quot;, in a shrill voice.

The basement is dim and hazy. Once you reach the bottom you see blood spatter and jenga pieces scattered around the floor.

There are gas flames around the edges of the room. &lt;&lt;if $BHmet is 0&gt;&gt;In the center, there is a small red-eyed beast with grey skin. It is quite small, about the size of a toddler, with a form that is almost humanoid, save for an oversized, misshapen head. It has a hunch back and one long pointed tooth. It sits before a game of battleship, and wiggles its single eyebrow at you suggestively. It speaks.

On the other side of the guillotine is the board game &quot;Operation&quot; enclosed in a see through box. You&#x27;ll have to put your arms under the blade to play. There is a pair of light-saber chopsticks on the counter. 

Blockhead emerges and chants a riddle to you:

&quot;I Welcome Thee to Cannibal&#x27;s Kitchen
It’s Not Too Hot so stop your bitching
And please don’t cheat, cause you’ve been warned
Just ask the corpse on the furnace floor
This game is fun, This game is free

He places his hands in the box, tripping the mechanism that starts the egg timer. 
You and the Jock anxiously watch as the Nerd performs his life or death operation. So far things are going well; he pulls out a funny bone and places it in the weighted tray. You can’t just sit by and watch, you feel the need to do something.

You pick up the chopsticks, your hands trembling. The egg timer begins to run. The entire contraption feels like it&#x27;s about to collapse. Sweat is pouring down your face as you steadily reach for the funny bone. With your shaky hands, you bump the detector while trying to remove the piece. Your face turns pale.

“You touch my knife, you lose your Life!”

You find a cloth, which you run under a tap, and a pair of tongs. You rush to the Nerd’s aid and start padding the sweat from his forehead and eyes. He awkwardly purrs and whispers to you “no one has ever touched me like this before”. A single tear rolls down your right eye as you continue padding his face in disgust.  

You anxiously look at the egg timer; you’re almost out of time. The nerd carefully grabs the last piece, the wishbone, and places it on the tray. The weight of the collective pieces pushes the tray down, turning the board around 180 degrees, revealing a key taped to the back of the game. The nerd quickly pries the key off the game and pulls out both his hands out to give you the key. His face turns pale as he turns back and realizes he left the limited edition lightsaber chopsticks in the box (signed and used by Mark Hamill himself during the shoot of “The Empire Strikes Back”). The Nerd thrusts his right hand back into the box, but before he can pull out the the sticks the egg timer rings and the blade drops, along with the Nerds hand.

Everyone stares in horror as as you watch the Nerd scream and squeal on the ground in pain and agony. He is bleeding out profusely and is moments away from death.


“Am - Am I gonna make it guys? Am I gonna be okay? I feel cold…”, The Nerd says as tears run down his face.

With no words, you all stare at the Nerd will soft saddened faces and he gets the message.

“Di- Did I look cool at least? ”, The Nerd says as tears run down his face.

You reply, “The coolest. Just like Mark Hamill.”

The upper floor is much larger than you expected, stretching upward like the inside of a tower. In front of you is a pile of human bodies intricately stacked upon each-other in rows of 3 going upwards. However, at the base there is only one body in the center. The tower is swaying.

As long as you followed our honour code,
But if you broke the rules again
This is where the fun begins.&quot;

“Oh fuck no” The Jock whispers, before bolting downstairs. Frozen in fear, you wait while the tower leans progressively further to the left. Your need to find something to stabilize the tower, but the room is bare. The implication is clear: two empty slots, and two surviving players. With any luck, that will complete the challenge and you’ll be set free.
